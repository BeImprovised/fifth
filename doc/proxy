Using proxies
=============

At the time, there are no GUI options or advanced config entires exposing
proxy support. However, proxies can be used with the usual curl environment
variables - see "man curl".

Example:
all_proxy=socks5://localhost:1080 fifth
http_proxy=http://user:password@1.2.3.4:5555 fifth
